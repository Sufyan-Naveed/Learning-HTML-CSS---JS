Practical Real-World Project: Personal Blog Homepage Project Description: Create a personal blog homepage that includes a variety of elements and demonstrates your understanding of HTML basics. The blog homepage should have a structured layout with a header, main content area, and footer. It should include text formatting, links, images, a table, a form, and semantic HTML tags. 

 Project Requirements: 
 Header Section: 

 Use a <header> tag. Include an <h1> tag with the blog's title. Add a navigation menu with links to different sections of the blog (use <nav> and <a> tags). Main Content 
Section: Use a <main> tag. Include at least three blog post summaries, each within a <section> tag. Each summary should have: An <h2> tag for the post title. A paragraph (<p>) with a brief summary of the post. An image (<img>) relevant to the post. A link (<a>) to read the full post. Sidebar Section: Use an <aside> tag. Add an unordered list (<ul>) of recent posts or categories. Footer Section: Use a <footer> tag. Include a table (<table>) listing social media links with two columns: one for the platform and one for the link. Contact Form: Use a <form> tag within the footer or in a separate <section>. Include text input fields for name and email. Add a textarea for the message. Include a dropdown menu for selecting the reason for contact. Add a submit button. Other Elements: Use text formatting tags like <b>, <i>, and <u> within your content. Ensure all images have alt text. Use appropriate semantic tags to structure your HTML document. Steps to Complete the Project: Set Up the Document: Create a new HTML file. Add the DOCTYPE declaration. Include the html, head, and body tags. Add a title in the head section. Create the Header: Add a <header> tag. Include the blog title inside an <h1> tag. Add a navigation menu with links (use a <nav> tag and <a> tags). Build the Main Content: Add a <main> tag. Create multiple <section> tags for blog post summaries. Include post titles with <h2> tags. Add paragraphs for summaries. Insert images with alt text. Add links to read more. Add the Sidebar: Use an <aside> tag. Create an unordered list of recent posts or categories. Create the Footer: Add a <footer> tag. Include a table with social media links. Ensure each row has two columns: platform and link. Add the Contact Form: Use a <form> tag. Add text input fields for name and email. Include a textarea for the message. Add a dropdown menu and a submit button. Format the Content: Use bold, italic, and underline text formatting where appropriate. Ensure all images have descriptive alt text. Check the structure and use of semantic tags. Review and Test: Review the entire document for correctness and completeness. Test all links, forms, and other interactive elements to ensure they work properly. By completing this project, you'll be able to demonstrate your understanding of the HTML topics covered in the first week. It will also give you practical experience in creating a structured and semantically correct HTML document
